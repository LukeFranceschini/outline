A wireframe renderer written in haskell.

This purpose of this project is to be able to create wireframe images in black
and white, from the perspective of a camera which can be at any position, 
facing any direction. A wireframe has been chosen because it is relatively easy,
with no need to worry about occlusion culling or lighting surfaces.

A simple file format has been created for this project, detailed in 
/docs/file-format.txt.
