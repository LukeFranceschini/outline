A file format is needed to store information about the location and direction of
the camera, as well as the location of edges.

The first line contains the position and direction of the camera, both of which 
are points, in record format. The first is the location of the camera, and the 
second is the point the camera is looking at. These points must be distinct. 

The second line of the file is a list of edges which will be rendered by the program, with an edge being defined by two end points.

The camera has a 90 degree field of view both vertically and horizontally, with
the focal point being in the center of the rendered image. So the image 
rendered by the input wireframes/horizontal-line.wf would have a single 
horizontal line across the middle of the image. The endpoints of the solitary 
edge lie directly on the edge of the image.

This file is processed using the read function of the types contained within the
file, which are instances of the Read typeclass. The .wf file extension is 
typically used, although it is not required. Lines beginning with a pound sign
are ignored as comments.
