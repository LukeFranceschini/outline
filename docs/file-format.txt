A file format is needed to store information about the location and direction 
of the camera, as well as the location of edges. The first line contains the 
position of the camera, as a point. The second line contains the orientation
of the camera, expressed as a tuple representing the rotation of camera in the 
X, Y and Z direction in degrees. The remaining lines are tuples of points which
denote the endpoints of the edges to be rendered. 

The camera has a 90 degree field of view both vertically and horizontally, and 
it's starting orientation (from which it is rotated) is along the -Z axis. So 
the following example would have a single horizontal line across the middle of
the image. The endpoints of the edge lie directly on the edge of the image.

The .wf file extension is typically used, although it is not required. Lines 
beginning with a pound sign are ignored.
